    "    The vector composed of the ordered triplet $(x, y, z)$ is trivial to resolve to $x\\uvec i + y\\uvec j + z\\uvec k$. If this vector somehow had multiple resolutions, that would imply that it refered to a point that had two positions along an axis, i.e. that the axes are looped. If we can take it as _given_ that any three basis vectors that are not parallel or coplanar are a linear transform of an orthonormal basis, then the same reasoning applies to the resolution along the transformed directions, just the same as the cartesian axes. (I don't feel like this is a satisfactory answer because that's a big _given_.)\n",

    "    Maybe another way to think about it is in terms of infinitesimal wiggles. If we wiggle the coefficient of one of the basis vectors, then the vector moves even though the other two coefficients remain the same. There shouldn't be any way to wiggle the other coefficients to compensate for the displacement along the first 'axis', because they're independent. How to phrase that as a proof?"
