    "    We can inspect the diagram above and see that the geometric interpretation of the distributive property of scalar multiplication makes intuitive sense. The angle between $\\vec a$ and $\\vec a+\\vec b $ must be the same as the angle between $2\\vec a$ and $2(\\vec a + \\vec b)$. Likewise, the angle between $\\vec a$ and $\\vec b$ must be the same as the angle between $2\\vec a$ and $2\\vec b$. With two angles proven to be the same, the third angle of a triangle must be the same since the interior angles sum to 180 degrees. It follows that the triangles formed by the bisection of the parallelograms in the diagram above must be similar, meaning they have the same angles, but only vary in size. Although the diagram establishes this by example with $l=2$, it's clear than $l$ should be able to have any real value because scalar multiplication of a vector can take any real value, and no real value can impact the angle of the vector (except $l=0$, which produces an undefined angle, but is a degenerate case for a triangle).\n",

    "    The vector composed of the ordered triplet $(x, y, z)$ is trivial to resolve to $x\\uvec i + y\\uvec j + z\\uvec k$. If this vector somehow had multiple resolutions, that would imply that it refered to a point that had two positions along an axis, i.e. that the axes are looped. If we can take it as _given_ that any three basis vectors that are not parallel or coplanar are a linear transform of an orthonormal basis, then the same reasoning applies to the resolution along the transformed directions, just the same as the cartesian axes.
